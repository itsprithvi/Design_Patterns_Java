It is also a creational design pattern.

Problem statement :
    If class has more number of attributes
    we want to validate the object before object creation so let's think we are validate at constructor
    If we use large constructor we difficult to understand which element is which
    Sometimes we don't have all attributes at the time of object creation
    If we use same method signature [ multiple constructor ]  then compile time error will thrown where some attributes have same parameter datatype
    We can use telescopic constructor but still we use multiple constructor

    We need something which is similar to Map allows us to have different values for keys and should have compile time check
        for key.
        Also it should have compile time check for values as well
        Object of one class can do all these so we can use one helper class for this

        Helper class is to get all the required details to create student object after validation passes

        So we use Builder class it takes all attributes and validate
