               Prototype Design Pattern
            ******************************

Problem statement :
    Given an object of a class, we need to create a copy of this object.
    ( create a new object with the exact same attributes )
    If we copy straightly from other objects, then client needs to know implementation of the object,
        in some cases, there are private attributes, which can't be copied.


    eg :
    Let's say we create a prototype object of classmate notebook.\
    All the objects can be copied from the prototype and just give values of frontpage and funfact.
